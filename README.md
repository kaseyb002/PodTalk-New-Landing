## HNBuddy - Landing page

This repo is for the landing page of the iOS application HNBuddy (available on the [appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hnbuddy-hackernews-client/id1312439587?mt=8)).

### Inspiration

Since I'm not a web designer, I needed some inspiration for this page. I found it there:

Also, the page uses [retinajs](https://github.com/strues/retinajs) to support high ppi screen and load the right images accordingly.
